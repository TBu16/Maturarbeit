- [[Abstract]]
	- When you start making notes in this bottom-up way, as in the Zettelkasten approach, it's important to develop consistency in your approach so that you can easily find your 'atomic notes' (which are your raw materials) at a later stage. In this video I aim to share a couple of ideas and frameworks that may help you avoid the same headaches that I've had.
	  
	  Timestamps:
	  01:02 - Defining categorisation (and therefore 'tagging') more broadly 
	  01:48 - Looking for common principles in other methods and taking them forward
	  03:45 - Context / subject / keyword tagging to resurface relevant notes later
	  05:45 - My method for tagging notes: Area, Books and Chapters
	  08:50 - Thinking in stacks or virtual working areas 
	  11:28 - Levels of abstraction or emergence
	  15:11 - Bringing it all together with a visual
	  16:10 - Looking for footholds for these ideas  in other frameworks
	  21:06 - Whats coming next - queries and indentation!
